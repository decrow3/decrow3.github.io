I am a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Dr Alex Huk in the Departments of Psychiatry & Biobehavioral Sciences and Ophthalmology at UCLA. My research focus is on the visual system, which I have probed using a wide array of techniques including electrophysiology, calcium imaging and psychophysics as well as computational modeling and advanced data analysis. My experience is mostly with marmosets, a small primate model which is gaining relevance as its usefulness in neuroscience research is becoming more widely appreciated.
